# RepoToText

**RepoToText** is a macOS CLI tool (written in Swift) that recursively scans a directory (e.g., a repository) and creates one consolidated `.txt` file containing each file’s path and contents. This is especially handy if you need to share or review a repository’s structure and code in a single file—particularly for Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

## Features

- **Single file export**: Combines all your source files and subdirectories into a single text file.  
- **Recursive scanning**: It scans subdirectories automatically.  
- **Customizable**: You can modify or extend the script to skip certain file types (like large binaries).

---

## Requirements

- **macOS** (any fairly recent version).
- **Swift** (the script is tested with Swift versions typically bundled with recent Xcode releases).  
  - Check via:
    ~~~bash
    swift --version
    ~~~
- **Zsh-compatible**: Tested with the default macOS shell (Zsh). The shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env swift`) should work fine under Zsh if Swift is installed.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ~~~bash
   chmod +x RepoToText.swift
   ~~~

3. (Optional) **Add to your `$PATH`** for convenience:

   ~~~bash
   # Copies the script to /usr/local/bin named 'repototext'
   sudo cp RepoToText.swift /usr/local/bin/repototext
   ~~~

   or

   ~~~bash
   # Symlinks instead of copying
   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/RepoToText.swift /usr/local/bin/repototext
   ~~~

   - Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`. On Zsh, you can verify by running:
     ~~~bash
     echo $PATH
     ~~~
   - If `/usr/local/bin` isn’t there, add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:
     ~~~bash
     export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     ~~~
   - Then run:
     ~~~bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ~~~

   - Once set, you should be able to run `repototext` from any directory.

   **Important**: If you used the exact commands above, the final command you’ll run is `repototext`, not `swifttotext`. The latter doesn’t exist unless you specifically named the script that way.

---

## Usage

### Basic Use

~~~bash
./RepoToText.swift <directory-to-export>
~~~

- **Example**: If you run
  ~~~bash
  ./RepoToText.swift /Users/MyUser/Projects/HelloWorld
  ~~~
  the script will produce a file called `HelloWorld_RepoContents.txt` in your **current** working directory.

- If you moved the script into your `$PATH` under the name `repototext`, just do:
  ~~~bash
  repototext /Users/MyUser/Projects/HelloWorld
  ~~~

### Custom Output File

~~~bash
./RepoToText.swift <directory-to-export> <desired-output-path>
~~~

- **Example**:
  ~~~bash
  ./RepoToText.swift /Users/MyUser/Projects/HelloWorld /Users/MyUser/Desktop/ExportedHelloWorld.txt
  ~~~
  This will create (or overwrite) `ExportedHelloWorld.txt`.

---

## How It Works

1. **Scans the specified directory** using the Swift `FileManager` enumerator.  
2. **For each subdirectory**, writes a note (like `[Directory]`).  
3. **For each file**, reads its contents and appends it to the output file.  
4. The resulting `.txt` file will look like:

Repository export for directory: /path/to/HelloWorld
=== /path/to/HelloWorld/README.md ===

HelloWorld

(contents)
=== /path/to/HelloWorld/Sources/main.swift ===
(contents)
…
=== End of repository export ===

### Shebang Explanation

The first line in the script is:

#!/usr/bin/env swift

This line (a “shebang”) tells the OS to use the `swift` interpreter found via the user’s environment. It allows you to run the script directly (e.g., `./RepoToText.swift`) instead of typing `swift RepoToText.swift`. It also works fine under Zsh, provided Swift is installed and visible in your `$PATH`.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **What if my repository is huge?**  
   - The output file might become extremely large. LLMs often have size/token limits, so consider excluding unnecessary files or folders before running the tool.

2. **How do I exclude file types (e.g., `.git`, `.png`)?**  
   - Currently, the script doesn’t have built-in exclusion logic. You can modify the `processDirectory` function to skip certain file extensions or patterns.

3. **I see `[Could not read file: ...]` in the output.**  
   - You likely don’t have read permissions, or the file might be locked. Update permissions (e.g., `chmod`, or run with `sudo`) if appropriate.

4. **Why do I get “permission denied” when trying to run the script?**  
   - Make sure it’s executable: `chmod +x RepoToText.swift`.

5. **Is there a Windows version?**  
   - Not officially. This script targets macOS. You can adapt it for other platforms if you have Swift installed there.

6. **Why isn’t my command recognized (e.g., “command not found”)?**  
   - You might have named it differently (like `repototext` vs. `swifttotext`), or `/usr/local/bin` might not be in your `$PATH`. Double-check the final name you copied or symlinked and verify your `$PATH` in Zsh.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No output file generated**  
  - Double-check your arguments: `./RepoToText.swift <valid-directory-path>`.

- **Unsupported Swift version**  
  - Update Xcode or Swift if you encounter compatibility issues.

- **Command not found**  
  - Make sure you used the same name when copying (e.g., `repototext`), and confirm `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.  
  - Reload Zsh config after edits: `source ~/.zshrc`.

## Additional Notes

- **Sensitive Data**: This script will expose *all* files (including potential secrets). Always review and remove sensitive info before sending it to an LLM or committing the output to a public repo.  
- **Modifications**: Feel free to add filters, chunk files, or otherwise customize the script to suit your needs.

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
